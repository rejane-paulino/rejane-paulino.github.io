#### (AWP - Inland Water) Adaptative Window by Proportion applied to Inland Water <img src="images/awpinlandwater.svg" width="250" align="right" />

AWP-Inland Water is a proto-algorithm that has been developed to address the reduction of adjacency effect on satellite-imagery applied to small waterbodies. The key principle behind AWP-Inland Water lies in its ability to adapt window-ranges according to local conditions across the waterbodies. For more details about this proto-algorithm, we recommend referring to the comprehensive study conduced by Paulino et al. (2022).
