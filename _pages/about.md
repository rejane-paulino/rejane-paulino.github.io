Welcome to My Personal Website!
======

I'm Rejane Paulino, a PhD student in Biosystems Engineering at Mississippi State University and a passionate young scientist specializing in remote sensing. My research focuses on satellite-based water quality, with particular interest in water optics, image processing, atmospheric and adjacency corrections, and the creation of synthetic satellite images.

On this site, you'll find detailed information about my research projects, publications, and professional background. I invite you to explore my work, discover my latest findings, and reach out if you have any questions or are interested in collaboration opportunities.

Thank you for visiting!
